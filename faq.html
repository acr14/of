            A “Share Link” allows you to share a URL to other contacts so that they can view your property photo and details. If you currently use Dropbox to share your photos, you can copy the property URL by going to the Property Details and from the drop-down menu on the top right corner select “Share Link”. When the URL is click from a PC, it will instruct the contact to install the app from mobile smart phone. When the URL is click from a mobile smart phone, your property is share within the app if the contact has OfferFast app install. If OfferFast app hasn’t been install, the contact is instructed to install the app. Once install, the property is share in the app to the contact.
